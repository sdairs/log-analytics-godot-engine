# Tinybird Log Analytics Starter Kit + Godot Engine

This is a fork of the [Tinybird Log Analytics Starter Kit](https://github.com/tinybirdco/log-analytics-starter-kit) to show how the kit can be customised to work with any kind of project.

In this case, a game built with the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/).
